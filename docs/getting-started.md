# Getting started

Running the Eligibility Server application in a local, non-production environment requires [Docker](https://docs.docker.com/get-docker/).

The following commands should be run in a terminal program like `bash`.

## Clone the repository

```bash
git clone https://github.com/cal-itp/eligibility-server.git
cd eligibility-server
```

## Create an environment file

Use the sample as the template.

```bash
cp .env.sample .env
```

## Build image using Docker Compose

```bash
docker compose build --no-cache server
```

## Start the server

```bash
docker compose up [-d] server
```

The optional `-d` flag will start in detatched mode and allow you to continue using the terminal session. Otherwise your terminal will be attached to the containerâ€™s terminal, showing the startup and runtime output.

After initialization, the server is running on `http://localhost` at a port dynamically assigned by Docker. See [Docker dynamic ports](https://docs.calitp.org/benefits/getting-started/docker-dynamic-ports/) for more information on accessing the site on localhost.

## Stop the server

```bash
docker compose down
```

## Develop with VS Code Remote Containers

This repository comes with a [VS Code Remote Containers](https://code.visualstudio.com/docs/remote/containers) configuration file.

Once you clone the repository locally, simply open it within VS Code, which will prompt you to re-open the repository within the Remote Container.

## Run unit tests

Unit tests are implemented with [`pytest`](https://docs.pytest.org/en/6.2.x/) and can be found in the [`tests/`](https://github.com/cal-itp/eligibility-server/tree/main/tests) directory in the repository.

The test suite runs against every pull request via a GitHub Action.

`pytest` is installed and available to run directly in the devcontainer.

1. Build and Open the Dev Container
2. Start the `eligibility-server` app with `F5`
3. From the main directory, run `coverage run -m pytests`
4. To see the test coverage report, run `coverage report -m`

## Run and develop the Documentation

```bash
docker compose up docs
```
