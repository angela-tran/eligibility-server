# Getting started

Running the Eligibility Server application in a local, non-production environment requires [Docker](https://docs.docker.com/get-docker/).

## Running the app locally for development

The following commands should be run in a terminal program like `bash`.

### Clone the repository

```bash
git clone https://github.com/cal-itp/eligibility-server.git
cd eligibility-server
```

### Create an environment file

Use the sample as the template.

```bash
cd .devcontainer
cp .env.sample .env
```

The .env file specifies the following values:

- `IMPORT_FILE_PATH`*: Must be either CSV or JSON.
- `INPUT_HASH_ALGO`: Must be one of the types available in the [`hashlib` library's `algorithms_available` function](https://docs.python.org/3/library/hashlib.html#hashlib.algorithms_available).

When using a CSV file, the following variables can be configured:

- `CSV_DELIMITER`: specify a custom delimiter or use the default ","
- `CSV_NEWLINE`: specify a newline or use the default of ""
- `CSV_QUOTECHAR`: specify a quote character or use the default of none
- `CSV_QUOTING`: default of 3 (no quotes)

These are the possible values for the `CSV_QUOTING` variable:

- `csv.QUOTE_MINIMAL`: 0 - To be used when the CSV file has quotes around entries which contain special characters such as delimiters, quotechar or any of the characters in lineterminator
- `csv.QUOTE_ALL`: 1 - To be used when all the values in the CSV file are present inside quotation marks
- `csv.QUOTE_NONNUMERIC`: 2 - To be used when the CSV file uses quotes around non-numeric entries
- `csv.QUOTE_NONE`: 3 - To be used when the CSV file does not use quotes around entries

Asterisk * indicates required

### Build image using Docker Compose

```bash
cd .devcontainer
docker compose build --no-cache server
```

### Start the server

```bash
docker compose up [-d] server
```

The optional `-d` flag will start in detatched mode and allow you to continue using the terminal session. Otherwise your terminal will be attached to the containerâ€™s terminal, showing the startup and runtime output.

After initialization, the server is running on `http://localhost` at a port dynamically assigned by Docker. See [Docker dynamic ports](https://docs.calitp.org/benefits/getting-started/docker-dynamic-ports/) for more information on accessing the site on localhost.

### Run healthcheck

To check if the server is running successfully, use your browser to get to the Healthcheck endpoint: `http://localhost:50252/healthcheck`

The page should read "Healthy"

### Stop the server

```bash
docker compose down
```

## Develop with VS Code Remote Containers

This repository comes with a [VS Code Remote Containers](https://code.visualstudio.com/docs/remote/containers) configuration file.

Once you clone the repository locally, open it within VS Code, which will prompt you to re-open the repository within the Remote Container.

 1. Build and Open the Dev Container
 2. Start the `eligibility-server` Flask app and database with `F5`
 3. Now you can run tests from the container.

Starting the Dev Container will run `bin/start.sh`, which runs `setup.py` and starts the Flask app. The `setup.py` script creates a table, imports and saves users from a JSON or CSV file specified in the .env file from the `IMPORT_FILE_PATH` key. CSV files will require

## Run tests

### Run unit tests

Unit tests are implemented with [`pytest`](https://docs.pytest.org/en/6.2.x/) and can be found in the [`tests/`](https://github.com/cal-itp/eligibility-server/tree/main/tests) directory in the repository. `pytest` is installed and available to run directly in the devcontainer.

The test suite runs against every pull request via a GitHub Action.

There are two different .env files to test against, to ensure the tests cover different `INPUT_HASH_ALGO` and `INPUT_FILE_PATH` types. To run tests on both files:

1. From the main directory, run `coverage run -m pytest -m databasetest; coverage run -m pytest -m settingstest`
2. To see the test coverage report, run `coverage report -m`

### Destroy and recreate database

In testing the database, you may need to teardown the database and restart a database from scratch.

The teardown script removes all users and drops the database. To tear down the database, run:

```bash
python teardown.py
```

To set up the database with a new import file or other configuration variables, after making any new environment variable changes, run:

```bash
python setup.py
```

## Run and develop the Documentation

These docs are built and published with GitHub Actions.

To run the docs locally:

```bash
docker compose up docs
```

Read more on how to run the docs [here](https://docs.calitp.org/benefits/getting-started/documentation/).
